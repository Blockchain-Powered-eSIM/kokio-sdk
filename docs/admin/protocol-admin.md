# Protocol admin

`admin.protocolAdmin`

The timelock that owns `registry`, `lazyWalletRegistry`, `deviceWalletFactory`,
`eSIMWalletFactory`, and `paymentAdapter`. Any change to those five contracts
that needs `onlyOwner` goes through here: a proposer announces it, a delay
passes, and anyone can then run it. This is what stands between a single
compromised key and an instant change to any of the five contracts it owns.

Four role-scoped surfaces do the actual work:

- **`proposer`** schedules a call. Needs `PROPOSER_ROLE`.
- **`executor`** runs a call once its delay has passed. Needs no role at all,
  anyone can execute a ready operation.
- **`canceller`** cancels a call before it runs. Needs `CANCELLER_ROLE`,
  which every proposer also holds.
- **`guardian`** bypasses the delay for three specific emergency actions.
  Needs `GUARDIAN_ROLE`.

```ts
const op = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule({
  address: registryAddress,
  abi: Registry,
  functionName: "updateVaultAddress",
  args: [newVault],
});
// ... wait out admin.protocolAdmin.getMinDelay() ...
await admin.protocolAdmin.executor.execute(op);
```

## proposer.schedule

Announces a single owner call. Use this for most changes: build the call
with an `OwnerCall` object, or use one of the `*Call` builder methods on
`registry`, `deviceWalletFactory`, and the others.

Keep the object this returns. `executor.execute` needs it to recompute the
operation's id, there is no other way to look it up afterwards.

```ts
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(
  call,     // an OwnerCall
  {},       // optional OperationOptions: { salt?, predecessor? }
  undefined, // optional delay in seconds, defaults to getMinDelay()
);
```

Returns: `Promise<ScheduledOperation>`, `{ hash, id, target, value, payload, predecessor, salt, delay }`.

## proposer.scheduleBatch

Announces several owner calls as a single operation that runs together or
not at all. Use this when the calls only make sense as a set, for example
revoking both a guardian's guardian role and its executor role in one step.

```ts
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.scheduleBatch(calls); // OwnerCall[]
```

Returns: `Promise<ScheduledBatchOperation>`, `{ hash, id, targets, values, payloads, predecessor, salt, delay }`.

## proposer.scheduleRaw

Schedules a call built from calldata that did not come from this SDK's
ABIs. Use this only when you already have the raw target, value, and
payload bytes; otherwise use `schedule`.

```ts
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.scheduleRaw(target, value, payload, predecessor, salt, delay);
```

Returns: `Promise<ScheduledOperation>`.

## executor.execute

Runs a scheduled operation once its delay has passed. Anyone with a funded
account can call this, it needs no role. Pass back exactly what `schedule`
returned: the timelock recomputes the operation's id from these fields, and
a changed value looks up an operation that was never scheduled.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.executor.execute(scheduled);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## executor.executeBatch

Runs a scheduled batch. Same permissionless rule as `execute`.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.executor.executeBatch(scheduledBatch);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## executor.executeRaw

Executes a call scheduled through `scheduleRaw`.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.executor.executeRaw(target, value, payload, predecessor, salt);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## canceller.cancel

Drops a scheduled operation before it runs. Needs `CANCELLER_ROLE`, which
every proposer also holds, so a proposer can cancel its own mistakes.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.canceller.cancel(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## guardian.unpauseInstantly

Releases a pause on a protocol contract immediately, with no delay. Needs
`GUARDIAN_ROLE`. Use this during an incident, when waiting out the normal
delay is not acceptable.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.guardian.unpauseInstantly(registryAddress);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## guardian.revokeCancellersInstantly

Strips the cancel role from a list of accounts immediately. Use this to shut
down compromised proposer or canceller keys before they can cancel a
legitimate pending operation.

This is all-or-nothing: if any listed account does not actually hold the
role, the whole call reverts rather than skipping that one silently.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.guardian.revokeCancellersInstantly([addr1, addr2]);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## guardian.disableAdminInstantly

Suspends a contract's admin key immediately, with no delay. Use this during
an incident, if the backend's admin key looks compromised. This only takes
power away, giving it back or naming a replacement is an owner action and
has to wait the normal delay.

`target` defaults to the registry, which is where every other contract looks
up the admin address, so suspending it there closes every admin-gated call
across the whole protocol.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.guardian.disableAdminInstantly();
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## acceptOwnershipBatch

Accepts ownership of every contract that has already offered it to the
timelock, in one call. Use this once, when setting up the timelock as owner
of the four contracts. Reverts if any target in the list has not actually
offered ownership yet, so check `pendingOwner` on each contract first.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.acceptOwnershipBatch([registryAddress, deviceWalletFactoryAddress]);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## renounceRole

Gives up one of your own roles. This is the one role change that does not
need scheduling, since the chain requires the caller to be the account
losing the role.

```ts
const hash = await admin.protocolAdmin.renounceRole(role, account);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## grantRoleCall

Builds the call payload to grant a role to an account. Hand the result to
`proposer.schedule`, granting a role is a self-call on the timelock and has
no other way to run.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.grantRoleCall(role, account);
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## revokeRoleCall

Builds the call payload to revoke a role from an account. Same pattern as
`grantRoleCall`.

Evicting a guardian takes two of these scheduled together in one
`scheduleBatch` call: its guardian role and its executor role. The revoke
call cannot tell that the two were granted as a pair.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.revokeRoleCall(role, account);
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## updateDelayCall

Builds the call payload to change the timelock's delay. `minDelayFloor`
still applies underneath this, so the delay can never drop below the floor
regardless of what this sets.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.updateDelayCall(newDelaySeconds);
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## disableAndNominateCall

Builds the call payload to suspend a contract's admin and name its
replacement in one step. The nominee still has to accept separately; the
role stays dormant until then.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.disableAndNominateCall(target, newAdmin);
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## disableAdminCall

Builds the call payload to suspend a contract's admin key on the normal,
delayed route. Prefer `guardian.disableAdminInstantly` during an actual
incident, this is for a planned suspension instead.

`target` defaults to the registry.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.disableAdminCall();
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## enableAdminCall

Builds the call payload to give a suspended admin its powers back. This is
the only way to lift a suspension, there is no instant guardian form of it,
by design.

`target` defaults to the registry.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.enableAdminCall();
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## unpauseCall

Builds the call payload to release a pause on the normal, delayed route.
Use `guardian.unpauseInstantly` instead if the wait is not acceptable.

`target` defaults to the registry.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.unpauseCall();
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## setDefaultPriceCapUSDCentsCall

Builds the call payload to set the registry's fallback price cap, in USD
cents. A zero cap only fails when this eventually executes, not when it is
scheduled, so a mistake here costs the whole delay before it is caught.

`target` defaults to the registry.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.setDefaultPriceCapUSDCentsCall(cap);
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## setPaymentAdapterCall

Builds the call payload to point the registry at a new payment adapter.
Owner only, deliberately not the admin: the adapter holds the spent payment
references, so an admin that could swap it would get an empty set back and
could record every purchase a second time.

`target` defaults to the registry.

```ts
const call = await admin.protocolAdmin.setPaymentAdapterCall(paymentAdapterAddress);
const scheduled = await admin.protocolAdmin.proposer.schedule(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<OwnerCall>`.

## operationId

Works out the id an `OwnerCall` will be filed under, without scheduling it.
Computed on chain, so the SDK and the contract never disagree about it.

```ts
const id = await admin.protocolAdmin.operationId(call);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## operationIdBatch

Same as `operationId`, for a batch. A batch hashes differently from the same
calls scheduled one at a time.

```ts
const id = await admin.protocolAdmin.operationIdBatch(calls);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## operationIdRaw

Same as `operationId`, for a payload built outside this SDK.

```ts
const id = await admin.protocolAdmin.operationIdRaw(target, value, payload, predecessor, salt);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## operationIdBatchRaw

Same as `operationIdBatch`, for raw payloads.

```ts
const id = await admin.protocolAdmin.operationIdBatchRaw(targets, values, payloads, predecessor, salt);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## getMinDelay

Reads the shortest delay a new operation will get right now. This is what
`schedule` uses when no delay is passed explicitly.

```ts
const delay = await admin.protocolAdmin.getMinDelay();
```

Returns: `Promise<bigint>`, seconds.

## minDelayFloor

Reads the immutable floor `getMinDelay` is clamped to. `updateDelayCall` can
never push the delay below this.

```ts
const floor = await admin.protocolAdmin.minDelayFloor();
```

Returns: `Promise<bigint>`, seconds.

## getOperationState

Reads where an operation is in its lifecycle.

```ts
const state = await admin.protocolAdmin.getOperationState(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<OperationState>`, one of `Unset`, `Waiting`, `Ready`, `Done`.

## getTimestamp

Reads when an operation becomes executable, as a Unix timestamp. Reads `0`
for an operation the timelock has never seen, and `1` for one already
executed, so check `getOperationState` instead of treating every value here
as a real time.

```ts
const readyAt = await admin.protocolAdmin.getTimestamp(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<bigint>`.

## isOperation

Checks whether the timelock has ever seen this operation id.

```ts
const known = await admin.protocolAdmin.isOperation(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## isOperationPending

Checks whether an operation is scheduled and not yet executed, whether or
not its delay has passed.

```ts
const pending = await admin.protocolAdmin.isOperationPending(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## isOperationReady

Checks whether an operation's delay has passed and it can be executed now.

```ts
const ready = await admin.protocolAdmin.isOperationReady(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## isOperationDone

Checks whether an operation has already run.

```ts
const done = await admin.protocolAdmin.isOperationDone(operationId);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## hasRole

Checks whether an account holds a given role. Get the role's id from one of
the `*_ROLE` methods below.

```ts
const proposerRole = await admin.protocolAdmin.PROPOSER_ROLE();
const canPropose = await admin.protocolAdmin.hasRole(proposerRole, account);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## getRoleAdmin

Reads the role that can grant or revoke a given role. Always
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which only the timelock itself holds, so every role
change on this contract is a scheduled operation rather than a direct call.

```ts
const adminRole = await admin.protocolAdmin.getRoleAdmin(role);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE

Reads this role's id off the contract. Held only by the timelock itself.

```ts
const role = await admin.protocolAdmin.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE();
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## PROPOSER_ROLE

Reads this role's id off the contract. Lets an account call
`proposer.schedule` and `canceller.cancel`.

```ts
const role = await admin.protocolAdmin.PROPOSER_ROLE();
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## CANCELLER_ROLE

Reads this role's id off the contract. Lets an account call
`canceller.cancel` and nothing else.

```ts
const role = await admin.protocolAdmin.CANCELLER_ROLE();
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## EXECUTOR_ROLE

Reads this role's id off the contract. Granted to the zero address on
chain, which is what makes `executor.execute` open to anyone.

```ts
const role = await admin.protocolAdmin.EXECUTOR_ROLE();
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.

## GUARDIAN_ROLE

Reads this role's id off the contract. Cannot be held by the same account
as `PROPOSER_ROLE` or `CANCELLER_ROLE` on the live deployment, keeping the
guardian's instant powers separate from the timelock's delayed ones.

```ts
const role = await admin.protocolAdmin.GUARDIAN_ROLE();
```

Returns: `Promise<Hex>`.
