# Registry

`kokio.registry`

The protocol-wide directory of device wallets and eSIM wallets. Present as
soon as `Kokio` has a `smartAccountClient`. Only three writes are reachable
from a device-wallet user operation; everything else on the registry is
admin-gated and lives on `admin.registry` instead.

```ts
const hash = await kokio.registry!.bindESIMWallet(eSIMWalletAddress);
```

## bindESIMWallet

Takes on an eSIM wallet as this device wallet's own. Use it after accepting
an ownership transfer, to make the registry's record match.

The eSIM wallet's `owner()` has to already be this device wallet: accept the
transfer first, then bind. This also clears any standby flag left over from
the transfer.

```ts
const hash = await kokio.registry!.bindESIMWallet(eSIMWalletAddress);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`, a user operation hash.

## toggleESIMWalletStandbyStatus

Flags an eSIM wallet as mid-transfer, or clears the flag. Use it to mark a
transfer as started or cancelled. Only the flag changes; the registry keeps
naming this device wallet as the holder either way.

```ts
const hash = await kokio.registry!.toggleESIMWalletStandbyStatus(eSIMWalletAddress, true);
```

Returns: `Promise<Hash>`.

## isDeviceIdentifierAlreadyUsed

Checks whether a device identifier already has a wallet deployed on chain.

```ts
const used = await kokio.registry!.isDeviceIdentifierAlreadyUsed(deviceUniqueIdentifier);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## paused

Checks whether the whole protocol is paused. While paused, the purchase and
token-pull paths on the device wallets and eSIM wallets revert. Check this
before offering a purchase.

```ts
const paused = await kokio.registry!.paused();
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## requireNotPaused

The same pause check as `paused`, but throws instead of returning `false`.
Use it when you want the failure to carry the protocol's own revert reason
rather than branching on a boolean yourself.

```ts
await kokio.registry!.requireNotPaused();
```

Returns: `Promise<void>`.

## isESIMWalletValid

Reads the device wallet holding an eSIM wallet. Despite the name this
returns an address, not a boolean, and it keeps naming the last holder even
after a release. Use `deviceWallet.isValidESIMWallet` to ask who holds it
right now.

```ts
const holder = await kokio.registry!.isESIMWalletValid(eSIMWalletAddress);
```

Returns: `Promise<Address>`, zero if never registered.

## isESIMWalletOnStandby

Checks whether a transfer is outstanding on an eSIM wallet. Independent from
`isESIMWalletValid`: a `true` here does not mean the wallet has left the
protocol.

```ts
const onStandby = await kokio.registry!.isESIMWalletOnStandby(eSIMWalletAddress);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## isDeviceWalletValid

Checks whether a device wallet is registered with the protocol.

```ts
const valid = await kokio.registry!.isDeviceWalletValid(deviceWalletAddress);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## uniqueIdentifierToDeviceWallet

Reads the device wallet registered for a device identifier.

```ts
const wallet = await kokio.registry!.uniqueIdentifierToDeviceWallet(deviceUniqueIdentifier);
```

Returns: `Promise<Address>`, zero if none.

## isESIMIdentifierClaimed

Checks whether an eSIM identifier is already held by a wallet.

```ts
const claimed = await kokio.registry!.isESIMIdentifierClaimed(eSIMUniqueIdentifier);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## eSIMWalletForIdentifier

Reads the one eSIM wallet holding an eSIM identifier. Set once and never
cleared, even across an ownership transfer, since the eSIM belongs to the
wallet rather than to whichever device holds it.

```ts
const wallet = await kokio.registry!.eSIMWalletForIdentifier(eSIMUniqueIdentifier);
```

Returns: `Promise<Address>`, zero if nobody holds it.

## defaultPriceCapUSDCents

Reads the fallback price ceiling, in USD cents, for a wallet that has not set
its own cap.

```ts
const cap = await kokio.registry!.defaultPriceCapUSDCents();
```

Returns: `Promise<bigint>`.

## paymentAdapter

Reads the payment adapter this registry currently points at. Read this
before going to `kokio.paymentAdapter`, which targets whatever address you
pass it rather than resolving the current one itself.

```ts
const adapter = await kokio.registry!.paymentAdapter();
```

Returns: `Promise<Address>`.

## usedPaymentReferences

Checks whether a payment reference has already been spent for an eSIM
wallet. Scoped per wallet: pass
`keccak256(abi.encode(eSIMWalletAddress, paymentReference))`, not the bare
reference.

```ts
const used = await kokio.registry!.usedPaymentReferences(scopedReference);
```

Returns: `Promise<boolean>`.

## requireLazyHistoryCopied

Throws if an eSIM wallet still has lazy-deployment history waiting to be
copied in. `buyDataBundleWithToken` checks this itself before writing a new
entry, so calling it first only turns that revert into a typed error ahead of
a user operation.

```ts
await kokio.registry!.requireLazyHistoryCopied(eSIMWalletAddress);
```

Returns: `Promise<void>`.

## requireDeviceIdentifierNotReserved

Throws if a fiat-path user's eSIMs are already waiting on this device
identifier. Worth checking before deploying: taking a reserved identifier
strands that user, since their history copy and wallet deployment both then
refuse it.

```ts
await kokio.registry!.requireDeviceIdentifierNotReserved(deviceUniqueIdentifier);
```

Returns: `Promise<void>`.
